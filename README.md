# Digital-Communication-Course
As you can see more detailed processing in this directory I have attached all of my MATLAB-codes experience during this course in cases of information theory aspects such as entropy calculation , average-length calculation based on huffman algorithm and finally compare the diffrence ways of information coding in marcov chain such as ternary or may upper dividing grouping.
furtermore in these series of project we are going to investigate the performance of Binary PAM during changing the SNR values as we notified above for more detail have a exact look on my codes and report
